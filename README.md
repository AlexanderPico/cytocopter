## Cytocopter - a Java based CellNOptR implementation in Cytoscape

This results in a point and click interface where users can run the same steps as they would using an R script without having to actually write any code. This version of Cytocopter is fully implemented in Java, but it remained consistent with the CellNOptR R package. 

In case you need the R back-end version, please visit the `Rbackend` branch of this repository.
